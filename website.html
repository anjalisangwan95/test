			<p>NORTH WATER - is my latest project,which I worked on. It was about creating a unique water bottle. Our concept is a branded water bottle. The bottle's material is made of hard plastic, with a design based on minimalism, design and social status. In this project, I have taken on the role of the designer and organizer. </p>

			<p>This i a design entry project I made for KADK - The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. This assignment was about gender neutrality, where I had to express gender neutrality through fashion. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Based on a mind map with discrimination as a subject, I have chosen to define the subject of religion and culture. These two are combined for a solution under the theme of diversity. In my assignment, I have tried to reconcile people through minimalistic design ideas, in which I have composed religion and culture. <br>This I have chosen since the origin of minimalism was a movement of a new change and a denial of identity, personality, culture and religion. 
There is a clear understanding that we have people in common needs. We all have the same basic needs as food, understanding attachment, sleep, etc. Culture and religion break us apart and give us different identities and perceptions of life. This is the main reason for being discriminated against - therefore this design suggests diversity. I want to design clothes that are gender neutral - and thereby achieve less discrimination and gender inequalities.For my solution I have chosen to design an outfit that emphasises the diversity among us. Clothes help unite and inspire us - and less discrimination can occur. </span></p> <button onClick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">read more</button>
